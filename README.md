# 🛠️ MLOps Hands-On Lab: CI/CD, Kubernetes & Jenkins (AWS-based)

This repository contains my hands-on lab work inspired by the Udemy course  
**"Beginner to Advanced MLOps on GCP - CI/CD, Kubernetes, Jenkins"** by **Krish Naik**.

> ⚠️ Note: While the original course uses **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, I have implemented all the MLOps practices using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** due to the lack of a GCP account.

## 🚀 What This Repo Covers

- ✅ CI/CD pipeline setup for machine learning workflows  
- 🐳 Containerization of ML models using **Docker**  
- ☸️ Deployment on **Kubernetes** clusters  
- 🔧 Integration of **Jenkins** for automated workflows  
- ☁️ Cloud-based infrastructure using **AWS** (EC2)

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to practically apply MLOps best practices in a cloud-native environment. It serves as both a personal learning archive and a helpful reference for others looking to implement MLOps workflows—whether on GCP, AWS, or other cloud providers.
